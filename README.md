# ToDoing!

This is a promotion project for a Frontend SSR position in React.

## Objective and Scope

This is a task management app. Since the purpose is a frontend promotion all data (Tasks and Tags) is temporary, being hard-coded in the `Main` class. Several subclasses allow to Create, Read, Update and Delete the Tasks.

## Methodologies and Libraries used

The main methodology to highlight was BEM, applied to CSS classes for styling but several libraries were used on the proyect:
* **React** as a main framework;
* **Npm and nvm**, for managing node packages and versions;
* **TypeScript**, for JavaScript typing;
* **Material UI**, for styling and UI design;
* **ESLint**, for linting;
* **React router**, for routing;
* **UUID**, for generating unique identifiers;
* **Dayjs**, for MUI-compatible date manipulation;
* **Dotenv**, for handling environment information;
* **Testing** library for testing (powered by Jest);

## Setting up and running the app

After cloning the project, go to the chosen directory and run

`npm install`

This should install the dependencies needed. Follow it up with a

`npm start`

which will get the app running in the port 3000 of your localhost by default.
